# Scandiweb Backend Test Task

This is the backend test task for Fullstack (React + PHP) at Scandiweb.

## Getting Started

To run the project, clone the repository and execute the following command:

Using PHP built-in server:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

and start Apache server using XAMPP or anything else similar.

To seed the database, run the following command from the `dev` branch:
```bash
php data/seed.php
```

## Future Enhancements

The project still has a lot to be added, such as:
- perfecting messy doctrine relations
- Implementing fetching order details
- And more...

I am always looking for edits and enhancements to improve this project. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to share them as I am aiming to reach my best. I know this is an endless road, but I try my best.
